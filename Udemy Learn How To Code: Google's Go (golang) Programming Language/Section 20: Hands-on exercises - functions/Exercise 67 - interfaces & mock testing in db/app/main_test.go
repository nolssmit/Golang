/*
Pointers are used in method receivers in Go for two main reasons:

1. Efficiency: When a large struct is passed by value to a method (i.e., without using a pointer), 
   the entire struct must be copied, which can be inefficient in terms of memory and performance. 
   When a pointer to the struct is passed instead, only the memory address of the struct is passed, 
   which is typically much more efficient.

2. Modification: If you want your method to modify the state of the receiver, the receiver must be a pointer. 
   This is because Go is a pass-by-value language, meaning that when a value is passed to a function, 
   a copy of that value is made in the function's scope. If the function modifies the copy, 
   the original value is not affected. But if a pointer to the value is passed, 
   the function can modify the original value.

   In the case of your code, both `Service` and `MockDatastore` methods are defined with pointer receivers 
   because the methods may need to modify the state of the receiver. For example, `MockDatastore.SaveUser` 
   needs to add a user to the `Users` map of the `MockDatastore`. If `md` were not a pointer, 
   `SaveUser` would receive a copy of the `MockDatastore`, and changes would only be made to that copy, 
   not the original `MockDatastore`.

```go
   func (md *MockDatastore) SaveUser(u User) error {
      _, ok := md.Users[u.ID]
      if ok {
	return fmt.Errorf("User %v already exists", u.ID)
     }
     md.Users[u.ID] = u
     return nil
   }
```

Also, note that even when methods only read the receiver's data, you might still want to use a 
pointer receiver for efficiency reasons, especially if the struct is large.

When the hashtable grows, we allocate a new array
